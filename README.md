# BMI-And-Calculator
Utilized NodeJS to create web server to calculate BMI and add two numbers together.

This is anything super fancy, it was just a learning experience to gain basic understanding of NodeJS and also Express framework to handle requests.

I am a huge fan of using small projects to breakdown concepts, then after learning I can implement larger projects.
